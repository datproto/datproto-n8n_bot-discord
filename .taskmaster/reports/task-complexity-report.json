			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Configuration Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the configuration management system into subtasks such as: (1) Design configuration schema, (2) Implement endpoints.json, (3) Implement environment.js, (4) Integrate dotenv for environment variables, (5) Add Joi validation, (6) Implement hot-reloading, (7) Write configuration loading and fallback logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing a flexible configuration structure, integrating multiple libraries, supporting hot-reloading, and ensuring robust validation. The need for environment-specific logic and runtime updates increases both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity, warranting a high score and multiple subtasks for clarity and maintainability.[1][3][5]"

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build N8N Routing Service Layer",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the routing service into: (1) Service skeleton and setup, (2) Command-to-endpoint routing logic, (3) HTTP request handling with axios, (4) Retry logic with exponential backoff, (5) Timeout and error handling, (6) Response transformation, (7) Circuit breaker integration, (8) Health check and concurrent request handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing advanced routing, resilience patterns, and robust error handling, all of which significantly increase cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. The integration of circuit breakers and concurrency adds further intricacy, justifying a high complexity score and detailed decomposition.[1][3][5]"

			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Set up winston logging, (2) Define error classes, (3) Implement error middleware, (4) Add correlation IDs, (5) Configure log rotation, (6) Integrate logging throughout the application.",
			"reasoning": "While error handling and logging are standard, the requirements for structured logs, custom error classes, correlation IDs, and log rotation introduce moderate complexity and require careful modularization for maintainability.[1][3][5]"

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Update Existing Scrape Command Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Refactor main handler, (2) Implement input validation, (3) Add data transformation, (4) Integrate error handling and user feedback, (5) Update command definition and response handling.",
			"reasoning": "This is a focused refactor task leveraging existing patterns, but it involves modularization, validation, and integration with new services, resulting in moderate complexity.[1][3][5]"

			"taskTitle": "Add New Command Types (Analyze, Monitor, Notify)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Implement analyze command, (2) Implement monitor command, (3) Implement notify command, (4) Add validation for each, (5) Add data transformation for each, (6) Integrate rate limiting and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Adding new commands is straightforward but requires consistent modularization, validation, and rate limiting, resulting in moderate complexity and a need for clear subtasks.[1][3][5]"

			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement healthChecker service, (2) Schedule periodic health checks, (3) Admin commands for status/logs/config, (4) Monitoring dashboard data collection, (5) Metrics storage (in-memory/Redis), (6) Integrate with node-cron, (7) Permission handling for admin commands.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves real-time monitoring, scheduled jobs, admin interfaces, and optional distributed storage, all of which contribute to high complexity and require multiple focused subtasks.[1][3][5]"
